Delhi, the capital city of India, has been grappling with a severe air quality crisis for many
years. The city's air quality is influenced by a complex interplay of factors, including
vehicular emissions, industrial pollution, agricultural residue burning, and inappropriate land
allotment to tree plantation. The resultant air pollution poses significant health risks,
including respiratory illnesses and cardiovascular problems for its residents. So what is the
solution? The obvious solution towards a better air quality is planting more trees. This
paper presents a solution in a more sustainable & smart way. It consists of an expert system
based on Machine Learning which suggests the required tree percentage to make the aqi
better or more sustainable practices based on the land availability in the particular districts of
delhi. This proposed system is trained using data collected in our research & analysis. It is
not limited to predict only the tree percentage required to plant but also suggest methods
other than plantation to beat pollution. Also it will suggest ways and methods to maintain a
healthy tree. This system uses google earth API to analyze the districts for the plantation,
SWI-PROLOG for building an expert system. An interactive UI is designed using FLASK to
make it easy for the user to enter the required input data.
